 * @brief Public methods for the calculator's engine.
 * @date 3.4.2023
 *
 * Mimics the behaviour of the most simple calculators.
 * No operator precedence, remembers only the last evaluated value,...
 * 
 * All public methods that work on engine structure look like this:
 * action_t caleng_*(engine_t *eng, ...)
 *
 * They always return value of type action_t which holds the return code and text to be displayed.
 * If the return code is other than OK, the text to be displated is undefined. In that case GUI
 * should show its own error message based on the return code.
